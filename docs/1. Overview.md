## Introduction

This page explains how goose works in more detail. If you just want to see the available configurations, see [README](./README.md)


It uses pure JavaScript templates for maximum flexibility. You don't have to learn another template language.

It doesn't inject any JavaScript, styles, or markup into your files.


## Overview

<!-- Templates are rendered no matter their content. To goose it doesn't matter what content a template has, as the rendering is just the execution of the render functions in the chain and the substitution of the variables. The content can be using transformations, e.g. markdown to html. -->

<!-- 

only templates and assets are outputted, layouts and global data are not,
templates are processed / rendered, assets are copied over unmodified
note: everything unrecognised is treated as asset and copied, not ignored! doesn't by default ignore unrecognised files!

 -->

<!-- 

Goose can be seen as a compiler. It takes files from the source directory, processes them, and writes them to the output directory. Many input files can result in one output file using templates, or one input file can result in many output files using pagination.

Any file of a transformed file type can have a frontmatter where it can declare properties, which it together with global properties can use in its body.

The rest of the files is just copied over without touching it. Files that are ignored aren't touched at all.

By default no code is injected, no additional JavaScript, no styles, no markup.
